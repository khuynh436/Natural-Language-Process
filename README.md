This repo contains a project overview and source code for the final project of IMT 574 - Data Science II for the University of Washington Information School, Master of Science in Information Science. 

# Introduction
It is estimated that 80% of data exists in unstructured form, and much of that is text. Methods such as NLP can harness that data and help us make sense of it. Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. 
Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.


In this project the objective is the classification of text in tweets to determine if the tweet is about a disaster or potential emergency or not.

Computers can now generate text, translate automatically from one language to another, analyze comments, label words in sentences, and much more.
Perhaps the most widely and practically useful application of NLP is classification which can be used for:
Sentiment analysis 
Are product review positive or negative?
Author identification 
Which author most likely wrote some document?
Legal discovery
Which documents are in scope for a trial?
Organizing documents by topic
Triaging inbound emails
...and much more!
